# Complete Python Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery

This repository contains all the codes and notes, which I prepared when I was pursuing this [course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101URkAkIZdlpbR3w=/) by [@aneagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie).

I have added all these codes (which also contains my notes inside the .py file itself) because I thought that it might help the community and fellow students to get everything at one place, and it will help them in learning and debugging the code, it will also save immense amount of time and frustration, and later for the revision purposes as well (just like the cheatsheet.pdf given at the very end of the course).

Feel free to fork and add/edit files in here. Also, in case you want the additional handwritten notes as well, kindly email me at saurabhagarwal1089@gmail.com

Additionally I want to say that, I have worked really hard in creating and keeping the Python codes and my notes up to date. It consists of my long hours of work, writing notes, coding and debugging to finally make this repository what it is today. And I really hope that it's helping you guys and our community.
If you feel like it has really helped you in your learning process and saved your time and frustration, then do consider supporting me. This will motivate me like never before and will mean the world to me :-)
